# FarmConnect

FarmConnect is a frontend web application developed during the SolutionHacks hackathon hosted by Google Developer Groups (GDG), to support sustainable agriculture, education, and community engagement in Canada. The platform connects schools, local farms, and donors to promote responsible consumption, reduce waste, and encourage youth involvement in the agricultural sector.

## Project Overview

FarmConnect strengthens the sustainability and long-term growth of the Canadian agricultural market by bringing youth closer to the **initial stages of food production**.  
By exposing children, teens, and young adults to local farms through educational tours, FarmConnect helps foster **responsible consumer habits**, reduce waste, and inspire future careers in agriculture and agri-food research.

The project aligns with:
- **UN Goal 12** – Responsible Consumption and Production  
- **UN Goal 11** – Sustainable Cities and Communities

## The Problem

- Over 400 tons of waste are sent to landfills annually from Toronto alone
- Consumers are increasingly disconnected from food production
- Canada faces a growing **agricultural labor shortage** due to an aging workforce and urban migration

## Our Solution

FarmConnect bridges this gap by:
- Making local farms easily discoverable
- Enabling schools to book educational farm tours
- Allowing donors to financially support underfunded school visits

This approach strengthens local food systems while encouraging long-term sustainability and education.
